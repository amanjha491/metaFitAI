## 📖 Overview

metaFitAI is a scalable microservices backend built with Java Spring Boot (v3.5) and Spring Cloud (v2025). It uses event-driven communication with Kafka and integrates AI capabilities using GROQ to generate dynamic fitness recommendations. The system encompasses centralized configuration, service discovery, and API gateway routing to support long-term maintainability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (User management)
  - MongoDB (Activity tracking and AI metadata)
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka
- **Service Discovery**: Netflix Eureka
- **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config Server
- **Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **AI Integration**: GROQ

## 🏗️ Architecture Design & Services

The platform consists of specialized, independent microservices:

1. **`configServer`**: Centralized configuration management for all underlying services.
2. **`eureka`**: Service registry and discovery.
3. **`gateway`**: API Gateway managing routing and acting as the external-facing entrypoint for all downstream services.
4. **`userService`**: Service backed by PostgreSQL natively responsible for user profile management.
5. **`activityService`**: Service backed by MongoDB for tracking physical activities/workouts, utilizing Kafka for asynchronous event propagation.
6. **`aiService`**: Service interacting with GROQ to provide intelligent insights, utilizing MongoDB for data storage and Kafka to subscribe to user and activity events.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Apache Kafka

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanjha491/metaFitAI.git
cd metaFitAI
```

### 2. Configure Infrastructure
Ensure you have the following infrastructure running locally:
- **Kafka** (Running locally on default ports)
- **PostgreSQL** (Create the database needed for `userService`)
- **MongoDB** (Create databases for `activityService` and `aiService`)

### 3. Build and Run Services
Each service can be built and run individually. Start the foundation services first before spinning up the domain microservices.

**Boot Order:**
1. `configServer`
2. `eureka`
3. `gateway`
4. `userService` / `activityService` / `aiService`

### 4. Build and start services:
   
   **Option A: Running locally with Maven**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   **Option B: Running with Docker Compose** (Recommended)
   
   Make sure you have Docker installed and running. Then execute the following command from the root directory:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This will build the Docker images for all services and start them together.

Ensure valid API Keys for GROQ are available in your local configuration context prior to starting the `aiService`.

## 🔄 Core Workflow

1. **Client Interaction**: Clients invoke REST APIs through the unified `gateway` service endpoint.
2. **User Profiles**: Manage accounts natively with `userService`.
3. **Activity Capture**: Sync fitness activities to `activityService`.
4. **AI Generation**: Relying on data across different service contexts, the `aiService` leverages GROQ to construct specific, personalized AI fitness analytics.
5. **Event Pipeline**: Interactions that span across bounds trigger messages pushed via Apache Kafka.
